# Queensland Police Watchhouse Data Visualizer

## Project Overview

This project automates the process of collecting, processing, and visualizing daily watchhouse occupancy data from the Queensland Police website. It aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of watchhouse occupancy over time.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Automatically downloads the daily PDF report of watchhouse occupancy from the Queensland Police website.
- **Data Processing**: Converts the PDF data into a structured format (CSV) for easy analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates visual representations of the watchhouse occupancy trends over time.
- **Automated Updates**: Scheduled to run daily, ensuring the dataset and visualizations are always up-to-date.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Download**: The script connects to the Queensland Police website and downloads the latest watchhouse occupancy PDF report.
2. **Data Extraction**: Using the tabula-py library, the script extracts tabular data from the PDF.
3. **Data Transformation**: The extracted data is processed and converted into a CSV format.
4. **Data Aggregation**: New daily data is appended to a main CSV file that contains historical data.
5. **Visualization**: Using matplotlib, the script generates graphs showing occupancy trends over time.
6. **Scheduling**: The entire process is scheduled to run automatically each day.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- requests: For downloading the PDF
- tabula-py: For extracting data from PDFs
- pandas: For data manipulation and CSV operations
- matplotlib: For creating visualizations
- schedule: For automating daily runs

## Setup and Usage

(Instructions on how to set up and run the project will be added here once the script is fully developed and tested.)

## Future Enhancements

- Add more detailed visualizations (e.g., by region, demographic breakdowns)
- Implement data anomaly detection
- Create a web interface for easy viewing of the latest data and trends
